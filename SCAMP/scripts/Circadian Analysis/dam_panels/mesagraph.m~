function rhythm=mesagraph(f,tau,peaklim,noplot)
%MESAGRAPH  Plot mesa data and find principal peak
% rhythm=mesagraph(f,tau,peaklim[,noplot])
%
% f,tau are MESA data (see per_mesa, d_mesa, etc.)
% peaklim=[min,max] is the range to check for peaks.
% If peaklim is specified, the highest peak between 
% min and max is marked in the graph and its x value retruned.
%
% noplot: if set to one, no plot is made (only rhythm returned)
% 
% see also: mesaplot
